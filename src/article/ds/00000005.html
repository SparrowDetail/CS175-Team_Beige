                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Nintendo 3DS family is renowned for revolutionizing handheld 
                        gaming with its dual-screen concept and touch-based controls. 
                        Over the years, several 3DS models were released, each offering 
                        unique improvements and features. This article explores all the 
                        variants in the Nintendo 3DS family, from the original 3DS to 
                        the last of its line.

                        The Nintendo 3DS was the next significant leap for the DS family, 
                        launched in 2011. It retained the core dual-screen concept of its 
                        predecessors but introduced glasses-free 3D technology, allowing 
                        players to experience depth and visual effects without the need 
                        for additional hardware. The 3D effect was adjustable and could 
                        be turned off entirely for those who preferred standard 2D gameplay.
                        <br>
                        The 3DS also featured a more powerful processor, which enabled more 
                        complex and graphically detailed games. It supported backward compatibility 
                        with DS titles and introduced its own suite of games, such as Super Mario 3D 
                        Land, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D, and Animal Crossing: New Leaf.
                        <br>
                        Like the DSi, the 3DS included a digital storefront—the Nintendo eShop—which 
                        allowed for the download of full retail games, indie titles, and classic games 
                        from older Nintendo systems.

                        The Nintendo 2DS was released in 2013 and removed the 3D 
                        functionality but maintained compatibility with all 3DS and DS titles. Its flat, 
                        slate-like design catered to younger players, offering a durable and affordable 
                        alternative to the more fragile clamshell designs. Its straightforward design and 
                        lack of 3D made it the most affordable model in the family, broadening its appeal.
                        Although part of the 3DS family, the 2DS shared much of the DS lineage, offering an 
                        entry-level handheld gaming experience at a lower cost.

                        The New Nintendo 3DS and New 3DS XL were released in 2014 in Japan and 2015 worldwide, 
                        building upon the original 3DS with enhanced hardware. Both models feature a 804 MHz 
                        quad-core ARM11 CPU, a slight bump from the original 3DS's 268 MHz processor, 
                        along with 256 MB of RAM and 10 MB of VRAM, improving performance for more 
                        demanding games. The New 3DS has a 3.88-inch upper screen and a 3.33-inch 
                        lower touchscreen, while the New 3DS XL offers larger screens at 4.88 inches 
                        and 4.18 inches, respectively. Both devices improve the 3D functionality with 
                        face-tracking technology, allowing a more stable 3D effect even with slight movements. 
                        Other upgrades include the addition of the C-Stick for better control, extra ZL/ZR 
                        shoulder buttons, and built-in NFC for amiibo support. The New 3DS also features 
                        customizable cover plates, giving users more personalization options, while the XL 
                        model focuses on delivering a bigger, more immersive gaming experience.

                        The New Nintendo 2DS XL was released in July 2017, providing a more affordable alternative 
                        to the 3DS lineup while retaining many of the features found in the New 3DS XL. It sports a 
                        clamshell design with a 4.88-inch upper screen and a 4.18-inch lower touchscreen, the same 
                        dimensions as the New 3DS XL but without the 3D functionality. Under the hood, it features 
                        the same 804 MHz quad-core ARM11 CPU, 256 MB of RAM, and 10 MB of VRAM, ensuring smooth 
                        gameplay and compatibility with most 3DS and DS games.
                        <br>
                        The New 2DS XL also includes the C-Stick for precise control, ZL/ZR shoulder buttons, 
                        and built-in NFC for amiibo support, similar to its 3D-enabled counterparts. Its lightweight 
                        design and slightly slimmer profile make it comfortable for long gaming sessions. 
                        Positioned as a budget-friendly option, the New 2DS XL offers a great balance between 
                        performance and portability for players who don't mind missing out on the 3D effect.
