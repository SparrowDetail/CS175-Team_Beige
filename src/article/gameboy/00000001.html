                        &emsp;This handheld console was released within japan in 1989, April 21st, with it being released in 
                        America later in 1990. It is an 8 bit device, with it being a hybrid of two different 8bit processors 
                        in one. The original gameboy was able to sell 118.69 million units today as of today! A fun fact about
                        the Original Game Boy was that each original game console game with a copy of Tetris to go with it free
                        of charge. The creator of Tetris was a Russian Mathematician and was a huge hit nation wide!

                        &emsp;Everyone has their game that has a special place in their heart, but there are a few games that
                        stand out from the rest. Some still being played today, even by myself as I still play number one on 
                        this list to this day! Game Boy also was know to have glitches you could perform to either give you items
                        or help you advance. Pokemon has different ones to help spawn in any Pokemon you want! Below are the top 
                        ten selling games from Game Boy: <br> <br>
                        &emsp;1 - Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow (46 million)<br>
                        &emsp;2 - Tetris (35 million)<br>
                        &emsp;3 - Super Mario Land (18.1 million)<br>
                        &emsp;4 - Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins (11.2 million)<br>

                        &emsp;Overall everyone has heard a handle full of these games, and play their modern counter parts today.
                        Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow as around 46 million sales per Wikipedia and with Tetris having a smaller, but 
                        still huge 35 million copies sold.

                        &emsp;Some of the main controls, and one of main Nintendo's outstanding features, was the D-Pad and the two 
                        playing buttons, 'A' and 'B'. To power the anicent beast you would need 4 AA batteries. Additionally to the 
                        basic command buttons for interaction and movements, there is 'START', 'SELECT' and a power switch to go along 
                        with your heafty 4 AA batteries. When inserting game cartridges, there is even a lock to not allow removal 
                        until seen fit! Ninento also gave the Gameboy a lot of accessaries, even more so with the Color, but with the 
                        original Gameboy, it also added rechargeable battery packs through a connector or an AC adapter which can allow 
                        you to play with no batteries! Lastly, the Gameboy was multiplayer with the ability to connect via a Link Cable. 
                        My favorite PokemonGame, Pokemon Crystal, is on the Gameboy Color and was the best for this feature!

                    <p>
                        &emsp;The following picture is the motherboard inside of the Gameboy, with it not containing much and have 8 KB 
                        of VRAM for picture. Compared to maybe something like the Super N intendo with 64KB of VRAM as it also has 
                        color, it does not seem much in comparison. The Gameboy picture itself would be on a 2.5 inch screen, which 
                        was LCD (liquid-crystal display), and the dimensions of 1.9 inches wide and 1.7 inches high. The screen produced 
                        a whopping 160 pixels wide by another whopping 144 pixels high for the standard resolution. The ratio for the 
                        resolution is 10:9 and has a refresh rate of just about 60Hz. Overall, the hand held device was bigger compared 
                        to its screen, with the height being 5.8 inches, width being 3.5 inches and depth being at 1.2. With the harder 
                        to see pixels, no color and needing to be around direct lighting or you wouldnt be able to see it due to the type 
                        of screen, those were the few main features the newer generation were to fix! <br> <br>
                        &emsp;Audio was processed through the 'Audio Processing Unit' which proceeded to have programmable channels: 
                        first being for voulme, how high or how low with the frequency, the second following strictly volume changes for 
                        high to low, then to another channel that plays any waveform, a shape on a graph of the shape of a wave, within RAM 
                        and lastly white noise that contains volume changes high to low. The Gameboy was very different in its regards for 
                        sound, as it was only of the only retro systems to use wave channels within its sound chip. Better names for these 
                        channels can even be Duty1, Duty2, Wave and Noise (very simple in regards for what each layer does respectfully).

                        &emsp;The Gameboy itself contains what is called a custom SoC(system on a chip). Diving deeper into the CPU, the 
                        processor that does most of the work is a Sharp SM83. which contains the Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 8-bit processors. 
                        On startup, the SoC uses a "256 B 'bootstrap' ROM" which is a process that sends through the processor immediately. 
                        The 8-bit DMG CPU also contained an 8 bit data bus with 16-bit address in place, reading off of an outstanding 64 
                        KB of memory. The Gameboy is also holding six 16-bit registers (which is just a location that is set to be quickly 
                        available,but relies on the processor). One example would reflect towards the picture above, where 'AF' are two 
                        good examples of 8-bit registers. 'A' for where operations involing math happens and 'F'for when it can flag 
                        other registers for their specific purposes. This was done due to the design of the hybrid CPU, and allowed for 
                        best optimization operation and looks wise. Even though old, still has plenty of interesting facts!

                        &emsp;The Game Boy is very old, so its specs are not that high end. A fun fact about the Assembly
                        language, is that they used the Z80 for games like Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow and even Pokemon 
                        Gold/Silver/Crystal until switching to C as the language some of these games are produced, which happened
                        around the Game Boy Advanced games. A brief break down of General Purpose Registers is a way a device
                        can compute calculations and other function. The Game Boy consisted of six 16-bit, while something like 
                        an intel processor that are 64 bit with 16 General Purpose Registers, that just shows how much technology
                        has changed over time.
