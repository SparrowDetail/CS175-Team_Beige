                        Phantom is the only secret boss on this list and in the series.  After dying in Megaman 
                        Zero 1 he lingers on as a cyber elf. This is the only boss that is fought in cyberspace 
                        in Megaman Zero 3 but he does pack a punch. The boss is balanced to account for you being 
                        overpowered due to the effects of Cyber space. Phantom is a lot like his fellow guardians 
                        in that he is an improved version from Megaman Zero 1 with new attacks. His quick movements 
                        and ninja technique will give  any player trouble.

                        Usually with the boss rematch, they are just rematches that are exactly the same before the end of the 
                        game. Meanwhile, when you get to Kuwagust Anchus, he brought his brother form the first game. They have 
                        all of their attacks form their respective fights and some team up attacks which makes for a thrilling 
                        tag team 1v2.

                        Copy X in Megaman Zero 3 marks the turning point for the game and the end of the Megaman Zero 1 throwback 
                        bosses. Compared to his Megaman Zero 1 counterpart, he is a vast improvement. They cut out the terrible 
                        2nd form and instead had what was good and it makes for a really good boss fight. Copy X uses the three 
                        elemental chips (lightning, fire and ice) against you and his weakness changes depending on what he is using. 
                        This fight really feels like you are fighting Megaman X if he had gone bad.

                        The Main antagonist and final of the series. Of course, they had to give him one of the best final bosses in the 
                        series. Dr. Weil is a simple yet complex fight in that the entire time, you are fighting under a 2-minute time 
                        limit. His weak spot is not always exposed and will only be vulnerable when he uses certain attacks. Also the music 
                        Falling down is one of the best in the series capturing the desperateness of the situation of the space station 
                        falling down to earth.

                        The final boss of Megaman Zero 3, the Messiah, or so he claims, is by far the best boss in the Megaman Zero series and 
                        in the Megaman franchise as a whole. This duel with the palette swap Zero is everything that the game builds it up to be. 
                        Before the fight it is revealed that the Zero you been playing as is not the original Zero, or at least is using a reproduced 
                        body, while Omega is the true Zero. Megaman X comes in at the end telling Zero that it does not mater what body he uses, he is 
                        Zero. Omegas fight consists of moves that you can do like charge saber and buster shots, but he also has moves form the Megaman 
                        X series like Ryuenjin. The music for this Cannonball. is without a doubt the best theme in the series with the climatic piano 
                        help making this duel of red more intense.
