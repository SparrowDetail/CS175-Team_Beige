                        The Super Nintendo was graced with phenomenal console sales, with over 49.1 million units sold worldwide. This could be impart attributed to
                        Nintendo's dedication to its game quality control. Nintendo introduced its seal of quality in 1985 to the American and European markets to
                        help distinguish officially licensed games from pirated knock-offs flooding the market. Now, with great console sales comes great game sales.
                        Without further adieu, lets get into the top 10 Super Nintendo Games by sales!
